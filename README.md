# sonarr-sma
Sonarr PREVIEW docker based on linuxserver/sonarr with SMA built in using python3

This is the dockerfile from mdhiggins/sonarr-sma but with the source image changed to the 'preview' tag of the linuxserver/sonarr image.
Currently, this equates to the V3 (aka Phantom) version of Sonarr: https://forums.sonarr.tv/c/phantom
