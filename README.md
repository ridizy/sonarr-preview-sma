# sonarr-sma
Sonarr PREVIEW docker image based on linuxserver/sonarr with SMA built in using python3

This is the dockerfile from [mdhiggins/sonarr-sma](https://hub.docker.com/r/mdhiggins/sonarr-sma) but with the source image changed to the 'preview' tag of the [linuxserver/sonarr image](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/sonarr).
Currently, this equates to the V3 (aka Phantom) version of [Sonarr](https://forums.sonarr.tv/c/phantom).
